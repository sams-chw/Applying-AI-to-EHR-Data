# Applying-AI-to-EHR-Data

In this project, I built a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and also provide an 
uncertainty estimate range for that prediction. This prediction will help identifying potential patients for a clinical trial for 
a newly developed diabetes drug that requires administering the drug over at least 5-7 days of time in the hospital
with frequent monitoring/testing.

This project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level, with appropriate filtering and 
preprocessing/feature engineering of key medical code sets. This project will also demonstrate the analysis and interpretation of the model 
for biases across key demographic groups. Lastly, students will utilize the TF probability library to provide uncertainty range estimates 
in the regression output predictions to prioritize and triage prediction uncertainty levels.

In the end you will be creating a demographic bias analysis to detect if your model has any bias which we know can be a huge issue in working with 
healthcare data!
